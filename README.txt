#CommonGood
<i>A platform for small donations</i>

CommonGood is a platform to help people in your community with small donations.
There are different so-called buckets - for example for education or health - to donate money to.
For every Euro donated, a donor gets one vote that he or she can give to a donee (it is possible to give more than one vote to a donee).
Once the bucket limit is reached, donees are sorted by votes and their wishes are paid for in this order.
